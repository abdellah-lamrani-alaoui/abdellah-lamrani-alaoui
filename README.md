### About me

I love sharing my knowledge with others.


### A little word about what we are building @Teker

âœ¨ People are impressed by Uberâ€™s customer support, which provides a seamless self-service experience with instantaneous in-app response. Teker ambition is to make this experience become the new standard for all companies.
Teker is a no-code platform to build a self-service portal to automate customer support interactions. The portal will guide the user through a succession of screens to (i) make him select his issue (ii) gather his inputs and (iii) provide him with an instant resolution.
According to a BCG study, 93% of users prefer a self-service over a chatbot. With Teker, companies will meet customersâ€™ new expectations while drastically reducing costs.
